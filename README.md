# budget-redo

meteor.js app. 

My 2013 app https://github.com/anherrera/budget is a pile of security woes encased in sacred amber that I can't touch because so much shit that was available in 2013 isn't any more. 

Also, generating the list of events is like O(N^2) and that shit sucks. 

So, let's build a new one in 2022.
====
# Using it

This project is running at [budget.weirdcoder.com](https://budget.weirdcoder.com/).

# Developing

install meteor 

```
npm install -g meteor
```

then 

```
meteor npm install
```

then 

```
meteor
```

I think? 


and it'll be running at http://localhost:3000
